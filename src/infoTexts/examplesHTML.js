    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <p>For each data set we have defined various example queries that are the easiest way to try the system. All of them should work except that some of them are computationally heavy (graph queries) and might not finish in reasonable time. 
    Anyway, even partial results to these queries are avaible in backend since Haskell executes them lazily.</p>
